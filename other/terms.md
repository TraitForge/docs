# Terms:
By using TraitForge, you acknowledge and accept that you do so at your own risk. Potential risks include, but are not limited to:

**Platform Restrictions:** It is possible that certain platforms may limit access to the TraitForge web application. To mitigate this risk, users are encouraged to securely store their wallet backup phrases or private keys.

**Security Exploits:** Despite undergoing thorough audits, there exists the possibility of an exploit targeting smart contracts or the Ethereum network itself. Malicious parties could potentially compromise on-chain transactions or key management, leading to unauthorized access to user data or assets. Users can minimize this risk by ensuring their devices are secure and enabling multi-factor authentication where possible.

**Critical Bugs:** Although TraitForge is audited and tested extensively, bugs may occur that could affect the user experience or cause transaction issues. Users are encouraged to review their transactions and balances regularly and report anomalies to the support team.

By agreeing to these terms, you absolve the TraitForge developers and contributors of any liability in the event of asset loss resulting from your use of the platform. You further indemnify them against any and all claims related to your voluntary use of the game.
