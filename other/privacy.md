# Privacy
## Privacy Policy

At TraitForge, protecting user privacy is a top priority. We will never store any user information unless it has been explicitly provided. The only information TraitForge may retain, following clear disclosure to the user, includes:

**Public Wallet Addresses:** To participate in TraitForge, players are required to provide a wallet address. This allows the game to associate your account with your on-chain activities, such as balances and transactions.

**On-chain Transactions:** Transactions on EVM Blockchains are immutable and public, TraitForge does not intend on storing any transaction for personal use.

## Plausible Deniability
**No Proof Stored:** TraitForge ensures that no evidence is created or retained that could confirm a public key belongs to a specific TraitForge account or user.

Information Never Stored
**User Details:** TraitForge does not store any user-specific information, such as IP addresses or real-world addresses, to uphold privacy.

## Canary Statement
If any changes are made to this privacy policy, the canary statement will be removed to indicate the modifications.

By using TraitForge, you acknowledge and agree to the terms outlined in this Privacy Policy. If you have any questions or concerns regarding privacy matters, please reach out to the developers on Discord.
