## NFT Honeypot Game with Strategic P2P Gameplay

### Abstract

TraitForge is a revolutionary NFT project that introduces an engaging game revolving around a central honeypot, offering strategic gameplay and strong value-accrual elements. It contrasts traditional NFT projects, which often lack compelling roadmaps or value mechanisms. By incorporating strategic gameplay, airdrops, and staking contracts, TraitForge aims to become a pivotal NFT game that attracts players of all backgrounds.

### Introduction

NFT projects are often characterized by lackluster gameplay and speculative profiteering. TraitForge aims to change this by creating a vibrant ecosystem where entities (NFTs) are central to gameplay and economic activity.

### Entities

TraitForge entities are NFTs with unique, programmatically generated art and traits. Each generation offers 10,000 entities with four main physical traits and an assigned role: Forger or Merger.

- **Generation 1 Mint:** The first generation starts with 10,000 entities at prices beginning at 0.01 ETH and increasing incrementally up to 100 ETH.

### Honeypot - "Nuke Fund"

The Nuke Fund accumulates ETH from game fees and mints. Players can claim a portion of the fund based on their entityâ€™s Nuke Factor, which determines the percentage of the Honeypot an entity can claim upon "nuking." Nuking permanently removes the entity from the game.

### Entropy

Each entity's traits and parameters are derived from a 6-digit entropy value. Parameters include:
- **Role (Forger or Merger)**
- **Nuke Factor**
- **Performance Factor**
- **Forge Potential**

### Gameplay Features

1. **Minting Entities:**
   - Mint unique entities with varying traits.
   - Compete to secure higher entropy values.

2. **Trading:**
   - Buy and sell entities on the TraitForge marketplace.
   - Tailored for the unique dynamics of the game.

3. **Forging:**
   - Combine two entities to forge a new one.
   - A new entity inherits averaged traits from its parents.

4. **Nuking:**
   - Claim a share of the Nuke Fund by nuking an entity, removing it from the game.

### Generations

Entities evolve through generations, with each generation capped at 10,000 entities. Generation 1 directly mints Generation 2 entities via merging, up to Generation 10.

### Economics

- **Nuke Fund Income:** 10% of Forge fees and sales, and 100% of mint fees go into the Nuke Fund.
- **Dev & DAO Funds:** 10% of all Nuke Fund income streams to the Dev Fund.
- **Airdrop:** Players who mint or forge entities are recorded in the Airdrop Contract, securing 50% of the total $TRAIT supply.

### $TRAIT Token

- **Supply:** 1 billion tokens.
- **Distribution:**
  - 50% Airdrop
  - 30% Devs
  - 10% Investors
  - 10% Liquidity

### Strategy

The game has multiple strategies: "Hold to Age," "Forge till Death," "Sell from Mint," or "Nuke to Win." to name a few.

### Conclusion

TraitForge reimagines the NFT gaming landscape with its strategic gameplay and robust economic mechanics. The project offers an immersive, lucrative experience that scales from a niche game to an industry behemoth.
