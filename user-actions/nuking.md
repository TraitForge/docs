# Nuking Entities

Maximize your rewards by engaging with the HoneyPot. Hereâ€™s how nuking works.

## How to Nuke an Entity

1. **HoneyPot:** The HoneyPot accumulates most of the game fees, 90% of Mint fee, 10% of Trading and Forging fees.
2. **Nuke Factor:** Each entity has a unique nukeFactor that determines the percentage of the HoneyPot you can claim. nukeFactor increases over time (2.5% per year * performanceFactor).
3. **Claim Your Share:**
   - By nuking your entity, you permanently remove it from the game.
   - In return, you claim a portion of the HoneyPot based on the nukeFactor.

Nuking can be a strategic way to maximize your rewards, but remember that it's a permanent choice!
