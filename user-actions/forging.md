# Forging Entities

Combine traits to create something unique! Here's how to forge entities in TraitForge.
This is done in the 'Forging' page.

## How Forging Works

1. **Roles:** Each entity is either a Forger or Merger.
   - **Forger:** Lists their entity and sets a fee.
   - **Merger:** Pays the fee to combine their entity with the Forger.
2. **Create a New Entity:**
   - The new entity is forged with traits averaged from both parents.
   - **Forger:** Receives the ETH fee.
   - **Merger:** Gains ownership of the newly forged entity.

Start forging to create powerful combinations!
