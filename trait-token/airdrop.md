# Airdrop Guide

## Overview

The TraitForge airdrop allocates tokens based on the entropy of the entities you've minted or forged. The higher the entropy, the greater your airdrop allocation.

### Entropy-based Allocation

The airdrop rewards players who have minted or forged entities with higher entropy. For example:

- **Allocation Mapping**: Users addresses are mapped in the smart-contract, the mapping is 'userInfo' which maps and combines all entropies of tokens you've minted/forged into one number. Larger userInfo recieves a higher allocation from the $TRAIT Airdrop.

### Address Mapping

When you mint or forge an entity, your wallet address is automatically mapped and recorded in our system. This ensures that your address is eligible for any airdrop tokens based on your 'userInfo' value.

### Key Highlights

- Your wallet address is mapped automatically when minting or forging.
- Higher entropy entities yield a greater token allocation.
- The Airdrop will occur and if you have an allocation, you must claim your allocation.

## Next Steps

Keep minting and forging to maximize your airdrop potential. Stay tuned for updates on token distribution, and don't hesitate to reach out with any questions.

**Disclaimer**: Make sure you are using the correct wallet address to receive your airdrop. TraitForge will not be responsible for tokens lost due to incorrect address usage.
